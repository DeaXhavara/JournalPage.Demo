# 📝 Journal Sticker Demo

Welcome to my Journal Sticker Page Demo! Digital scrapbooking meets a basic note app:

## 🌟 What It Does

This is a tiny, single-page journal where you can:
- Choose a writing theme to get inspired
- Drag stickers into your note to spice it up
- Throw those same stickers into the trash as preferred 
- A playful interface that gives off retro journaling vibes

### Purpose Of The Page

This isn't a full-featured app. It's a **demo**. A project built to showcase:
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Drag-and-drop logic
- Simple user interaction
- Aesthetic layout and font usage

## 💡 Future Plans 

If this were to level up to a legit product, here's what could happen:
- ✨ **Persistent journals**: Save your entries to a database
- 🧠 **User accounts**: Log in and manage your own private journals
- 🌚 **Dark mode**: Convenient to use during night time.
- 🎨 **More stickers & sticker packs**: Grouped in categories
- 💾 **Autosave**: Prevents data loss.
- 📱 **Mobile optimization**: Journal on-the-go
- 🔐 **Privacy options**: Lock your notes, share only what you want

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
